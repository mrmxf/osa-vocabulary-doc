SMPTE ST 2117-1 (VC-6) is a versatile intra-frame compression scheme. This document maps the VC-6
bitstream into the MXF Generic Container. The usage of this mapping to synchronise with other components
such as audio and video is outside the scope of this document.

The MXF Generic Container is a streamable Essence Container that can be placed on any suitable transport and stored.
SMPTE ST 379-1 defines the MXF Generic Container as the native Essence Container in MXF files.
SMPTE ST 379-2 defines the MXF Constrained Generic Container.

Other MXF mapping documents such as SMPTE ST 382 define how Audio can be mapped and synchronised with the video stream in the MXF Generic Container.
